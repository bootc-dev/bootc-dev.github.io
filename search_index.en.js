in-place operating system updates using OCI/Docker container images.\nMotivation\nThe original Docker container model of using \"layers\" to model applications has been extremely successful. This project aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format for base operating system updates.\nThe container image includes a Linux kernel (in e.g. /usr/lib/modules), which is used to boot. At runtime on a target system, the base userspace is not itself running in a \"container\" by default. For example, assuming systemd is in use, systemd acts as pid1 as usual---there's no \"outer\" process. More about this in the docs; see below.\nStatus\nThe CLI and API are considered stable. We will ensure that every existing system can be upgraded in place seamlessly across any future changes.\nDocumentation\nThe project documentation is hosted on a different site: Docs\nVersioning\nAlthough bootc is not released to crates.io as a library, version numbers are expected to follow semantic versioning standards. This practice began with the release of version 1.2.0; versions prior may not adhere strictly to semver standards.\nAdopters (base and end-user images)\nThe bootc CLI is just a client system; it is not tied to any particular operating system or Linux distribution. You very likely want to actually start by looking at ADOPTERS.md.\nCommunity discussion\n\nGithub discussion forum for async discussion\n#bootc-dev on CNCF Slack for live chat\nRecurring live meeting hosted on CNCF Zoom each Friday at 15:30 UTC.\nMeeting notes on HackMD\n\nThis project is also currently tightly related to the previously mentioned Fedora/CentOS bootc project, and many developers monitor the relevant discussion forums there. In particular, there's a Matrix channel and a weekly chat meeting; learn more.\nDeveloping bootc\nAre you interested in working on bootc? Great!

We'll mostly ignore the JSON part\nhere, but there's a lot to unpack (pun and foreshadowing intended)\nwith regards to tar and how it interacts with the various pieces that\nwork in conjunction to make containers a reality.\nA refresher on tar\nLet's explore a key quirk of tar from which everything else we'll\ndiscuss follows.\nFirst, let's create a basic tar archive, which contains a directory\nwith a file inside of the directory:\n\nNow let's list the contents of the tar archive:\n\nOk, that makes sense.  We see the directory and the file we added to\nthe archive.\nBut here's the key bit:  What happens if you add only the file to the archive?\n\nNow the archive has metadata only for the file.  You can deduce from\nthe path foo/bar that there is a directory foo involved, but you\ncan't definitively know how foo is supposed to look.  What are the\npermissions, owner, group, mtime?  We don't know.  So what happens if\nyou extract this tar archive?\n\nIt implicitly creates the directory foo in order to put bar at the\ncorrect path.  This makes sense.  But notice foo gets created with\nmetadata that is dependent on the environment in which the unpacking\nof the archive happened.  In the above example, you can see that the\ntimestamp on the directory is 10 minutes later than the timestamp of\nthe bar file inside.  This is because it took me 10 minutes of\nwriting and editing this post before I did the unpack operation.  I\ncan set my umask to something else and extract it a second time, and\nnow we'll see a different timestamp and different permissions:\n\nOCI image spec\nOCI container images are serialized as a series of\ntarballs\nthat are applied on top of each other to create the complete\nfilesystem.  We'll get back to the specifics of that operation a bit\nlater.\nThe entire layer specification is worth reading, but we'll focus on\ntwo parts.  First, how to determine changes:\n\nAnd then the following section on representing changes:\n\nBut note that the changeset says nothing about the directories higher\nin the filesystem.  So in the above example, it would be perfectly\nvalid (and more correct) to generate changeset tar archives which are\nincomplete in the same manner we described above.  Most notably, these\nchangesets would not contain tar entries for the directories /etc\nand /bin.\nThis oversight in the specification is not new or surprising.  There\nis an open issue from\n2017 which\ndescribes exactly this problem.  There is a linked pull\nrequest which\nhas been open since late 2022 with intermittent discussion, but no\nconsensus or resolution has been reached yet.\nThis has led to some projects implementing their own workarounds to\ndeal with this behavior.  The containerd project as an example\nnoted this\nissue in 2017\nand worked around\nit by creating\nexplicit archive directory entries for parents.\nRechunking in bootc / rpm-ostree\nBase images used via bootc are typically post-processed and\nfinalized via the rpm-ostree\nrechunker.\nThe general idea (oversimplifying a bit for brevity) is that the tool\ncan inspect the RPM database and map each file in the container to its\nassociated RPM.  It then \"rechunks\" the container by creating a new\nlayer for each RPM, where the layer contains the files for that RPM\nand only that RPM.  This ensures that when a new version of an RPM is\nreleased in the future, when it is integrated into a new base image,\nonly the layer associated with that RPM will need to be re-downloaded\nby the end user.\nHowever, consider a directory like /usr.  This is owned by the\nfilesystem package which contains all of the shared base directories\nin the system.  This directory will be included in the layer\nassociated with the filesystem package with all of its related\nmetadata.\nNow, almost every other package in the system is going to have some\namount of content that is shipped under the /usr hierarchy.\nOriginally, the rpm-ostree rechunker would omit the archive entry\nfor /usr in each package layer.\nThis however would cause the behavior of indeterminate tar archives\ndiscussed above to be manifest in the final container.  For example,\nit was noted in this composefs-rs\nissue.\nWe worked around this issue by creating a new\nformat-version for\nthe rpm-ostree rechunker, which creates all of the parent\ndirectories in each tar layer.  This is similar to the fix implemented\nas noted above by the containerd project.  This works, but it's not\nideal.  It means that all of the parent directories and their\nrespective metadata have to be duplicated across every layer in the\nimage.  This is an unnecessary waste of disk space and bandwidth.\nWhy isn't this a more widespread problem?\nWhen I first realized what was going on here, I thought I could\ntrigger this behavior with a Containerfile like this:\n\nBut alas:\n\nBut wait... the directory mtime is (correctly) still zeroed from the\nfirst layer.  So... everything up until now is a lie?\nNo!  If we pull apart the last tar layer, we'll see that it actually\ndoes contain a directory entry for /foo, even though it's not\nmodified in any way during the last RUN invocation.  I'll skip the\npart where I re-exported the image to an oci-dir just to make it\neasier to look through the layers.  Just trust me when I say this is\nthe tarball that gets generated for the last layer:\n\nOk, so /foo is there.  But... why?  We didn't modify it.  Deeper\ndown the rabbit hole we go.\nOverlayfs\nSpoiler: the answer is\noverlayfs.\nThe OCI spec defines the image format, but notably it does not\nspecify any particular implementation details on how to store, manage,\nand stitch together the final container image from its individual\nlayers.\nIn reality, container runtimes such as podman (via\ncontainers-libs,\nformerly containers-storage) use the kernel filesystem overlayfs to\nstitch together the layers into the final realized view of the world.\nA RUN invocation in a Containerfile is in a nutshell this series\nof steps:\n\nMount the previous layer (and recursively, layers prior to that)\nas a lowerdir in an overlayfs filesystem.\nPerform the RUN invocation in the mounted filesystem.\nCollect the contents of the resulting upperdir directory.  This\nbecomes the tarball for that layer.\n\nThis process is how we end up with our /foo directory duplicated\ninto the final layer, even though we did not modify it.  We can mock\nthis out just using an overlay mount and basic commands.\nFirst, mock our lower layer, and set the mtime:\n\nNext, mount it via overlayfs:\n\nNow we simulate creating the new layer:\n\nFinally we can unmount the overlayfs mount and observe the contents of\nthe upper dir:\n\nSo that's where our /foo entry comes from.  This behavior is\nexplained in the overlayfs\ndocumentation:\n\nSince the content of the layer tarball is taken directly from the\nupper, we end up getting a copy of /foo via this process.\nWhere do we go from here?\nHopefully I have explained the situation adequately and this all makes\nsense.  I have achieved some amount of inner peace that comes with\nreaching understanding.\nHowever... I still don't like it.  I think we can do better.\nHere's the thing for bootc: in our rechunked images, I don't want to\ninclude the same directories over and over again in every single\nlayer.  It shouldn't be necessary, and by strict reading of the OCI\nspec we shouldn't do that if the directories are unchanged (which\nthey aren't).\nBut in the current state of the world, if we don't duplicate those\nentries into every layer, we end up with non-deterministic directory\nmetadata when our OCI image is mounted and viewed through the lens of\noverlayfs.  This is fundamentally broken as we move bootc into a\nfuture where\ncomposefs and\nfsverity are used\nto harden and validate images.  Ideally a container image should be\nable to measure its own fsverity hash in a reproducible manner.  Today\nthat is not possible.\nSo the following is what I've done as a proof-of-concept (a huge\nmotivation for writing this post in the first place was to\nexhaustively explain my justification for why this is needed).  I've\nwritten and tested a patch (still needs refining before submitting)\nfor overlayfs which does the following:\n\nAdds a new feature passthrough (naming bikeshedable) which\nfunctions similarly to the metacopy feature.\nUses the trusted.overlay.passthrough to flag directories as\n\"structural-only\".\nWhen encountering a directory with the xattr, searches through the\nlowerdirs until it finds a directory which does not have the xattr\nset.  The metadata for this layer is used.  (If no unflagged\nlowerdir is found, it falls back to the current behavior of using\nnon-deterministic local metadata)\n\nHere's an example.  This is similar to our manual overlayfs example\nabove, except this uses two lower layers to show how unpacking a tar\nlayer with incomplete directory information might look.\nFirst, create our base layer again:\n\nThen, in our second layer we create the baz file.  This time we set\nthe passthrough xattr on /foo, which is how I envision this all\nworking when a container storage engine unpacks a tar archive with\nincomplete parent directory information.  Ideally this layer should\ninclude a tar entry for foo/bar/baz and (arguably) foo/bar since\nthe directory metadata for bar should be updated to reflect the\naddition of bar.  But it definitely should not include an entry\nfor foo/:\n\nNow let's mount it with the patched overlayfs.  First, we'll specify\npassthrough=off to show the existing behavior:\n\nHere the foo directory has whatever metadata we created for it when\nwe \"unpacked\" it with the command mkdir -p second_layer/foo/bar\nabove.  This is what we're trying to avoid.\nNow let's unmount and remount with passthrough=on:\n\nNow we have the metadata for foo being passed through the second\nlayer and retrieved from the base layer, which is the behavior we\nwant.\nConclusion\nEnsuring that OCI image layers are able to only ship content that\nthey've modified will aid reproducibility and help unlock\noptimizations by avoiding having derived layers always need to inherit\nmetadata from their parent. At the current time, however, tooling\ncreating OCI images should include their parent information in order\nto maximize compatibility. We are looking forward to a future where\nthat's not necessary though!\n","id":"https://bootc-dev.github.io/blog/2025-dec-15-blog-containers-pitfalls-of-incomplete-tar-archives/","title":"Containers: pitfalls of incomplete tar archives"},"https://bootc-dev.github.io/news/":{"body":"","id":"https://bootc-dev.github.io/news/","title":"News"},"https://bootc-dev.github.io/news/2025-july-11-community-meeting/":{"body":"Attendees:\n\nJoseph Marrero Corchado (Red Hat, Inc.)\nColin Walters\nRobert Sturla (Tesco Bank/Universal Blue)\nLaura Santamaria (she/her)\nHristo Marinov\nJohn Eckersberg (Red Hat, Inc.)\nDusty (he/him)\nAntheas Kapenekakis (Bazzite)\nMohan\nChris Kyrouac\nGursewak Mangat\n\nAgenda:\n\nNew release status: bootc-dev/bootc#1390\n\nfolks agreed on this\n\n\n[Laura] KubeCon NA 2025 Project Pavilion application\n\nNovember 10-13 - Atlanta, Georgia\nWho is going to KubeCon NA 2025 already?\n\nLaura\n\n\nWe'll get a project pavilion submission scheduled (probably from Joseph or Colin who already submitted a talk)\n\n\nUblue - Collaboration\n\nFolks are joining :)\nRobert, Antheas from the Ublue community\nColin would like to do 1:1s\n\ndustymabe: an office hours like set time could help facilitate this (+1 - Laura)\n\n\n\n\nrechunker alignment\nprogress-fd\nsystemd-sysext frontend\n\nMotivated by combinatorial explosion of gnome|kde * nvidia|amd * surface|framework|lenovo\ndiscussion of downsides of systemd-sysext as defined today, vs\n\n\n\nTODO:\n\n\nPut project pavilion application\n\nKeep smaller, more focused meetings\n\n","id":"https://bootc-dev.github.io/news/2025-july-11-community-meeting/","title":"Bootc Community Meeting Notes - 11 July 2025"},"https://bootc-dev.github.io/news/2025-july-18-community-meeting/":{"body":"Attendees:\n\nLaura Santamaria (she/her; Red Hat)\nHristo Marinov\nFernando Lozano\nColin Walters (he/him; Red Hat)\nJoseph Marrero Corchado (Red Hat, Inc.)\nMatteo Piccinini (n/a)\nRobert Sturla (Tesco Bank)\nDusty Mabe\nChris Kyrouac\nGursewak Mangat\nJohn Eckersberg (Red Hat, Inc.)\n\nAgenda:\n\nRelease 1.5.1\n\nThanks @robert!\n\n\n[Laura] project pavilion update?\n\nRequest form due Monday, shouldn't block on travel\nLet's do it live\n✅\n\n\n[Laura] Static site generation for landing page\n\nReview!\nbootc-dev/bootc-dev.github.io#3\nadding logos as examples: CoreOS site; BluefinOS\n\n\n[Colin] QMU banned contributions from AI.
