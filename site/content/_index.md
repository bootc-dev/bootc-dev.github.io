title: bootc
---

Transactional, in-place operating system updates using OCI/Docker container images.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using "layers" to model applications has been extremely successful. This project aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format for base operating system updates.

The container image includes a Linux kernel (in e.g. /usr/lib/modules), which is used to boot. At runtime on a target system, the base userspace is not itself running in a "container" by default. For example, assuming systemd is in use, systemd acts as pid1 as usual - there's no "outer" process. More about this in the docs; see below.

## Status

The CLI and API are considered stable. We will ensure that every existing system can be upgraded in place seamlessly across any future changes.

## Documentation

The project documentation is hosted on a different site: [https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/)

## Versioning

Although bootc is not released to crates.io as a library, version numbers are expected to follow semantic versioning standards. This practice began with the release of version 1.2.0; versions prior may not adhere strictly to semver standards.

## Adopters (base and end-user images)

The bootc CLI is just a client system; it is not tied to any particular operating system or Linux distribution. You very likely want to actually start by checking [Adopters](about/adopters).

This project is also tightly related to the previously mentioned Fedora/CentOS bootc project, and many developers monitor the relevant discussion forums there. In particular there's a Matrix channel and a weekly video call meeting for example: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/community/.
